		<a href="http://akinga323.tumblr.com/"><h3>Four Poems Tumblr</h3></a>
		<br>
		<p>This project is centered around the republishing of four poems from the musuem of love by Eric Amann.  Each poem has been rewritten into small phrases or words to better represent the emotions, feelings, or thoughts of each.  The use of animation, typography, and images help to give a better link between the poems and the platform Tumblr.  By giving the poem its own Tumblr it looks as thought it reblogged or favorited this content to represent itself. </p>
