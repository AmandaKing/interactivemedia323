	<h1><span="em">that language</span> is so basic is how it appears from the 
		unreflective field of vision like the guide book's:
		from the victor emannuel monument the best view of 
		rome is had because it is in one place from which 
		the monument itself is not visible language is the 
		labyrinth we live in the labyrinth we create by 
		living it is the monument we stand on the scene 
		we look at the tool we look through & the tool 
		by which we create the stand the scene the tool 
		as well as the stance the appreciation & the use
		& the user to be human is to sculpt paint compose 
		bake weave tailor sweep scrub polish w/time (SOUND) 
		& space (VISUAL) language or both to be human 
		is to be poet at its broadest sense
