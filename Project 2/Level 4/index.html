<p class="text">
that language is so basic <br>
is how it appears <br>
from the unreflective field of vision <br>
like the guide book's: from  <br>
the victor emannuel monument <br>
the best view of rome <br>
is had because it is in one place <br>
from which the monument itself <br>
is not visible language <br>
is the labyrinth we live in <br>
the labyrinth we create 
by living <br>
it is the monument we <br>
stand on the scene we look at  <br>
the tool we look through  <br>
& the tool by which we create <br>
the stand the scene the tool <br>
as well as the stance <br>
the appreciation <br>
& the use  <br>
& the user  <br>
to be human <br>
is to sculpt paint compose bake <br>
weave tailor sweep scrub polish <br>
w/time (SOUND) & space (VISUAL) language  <br>
or both <br> 
to be human <br>
is to be poet <br>
at its broadest sense<br>
