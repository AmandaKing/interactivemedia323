		<h3>An explanation of this site (project).</h3>

			<p class="intro2">I hope that you were able to take away a deeper meaning or understanding of this project.  There are two main views presented in the dialect.  First is the girl fighting with the viewer as you encourage her to think better of herself and to fight for a better life. The second, is the girl having an internal struggle within herself.<br>  <br>

			However, both views or whichever path you take, it will always end up at the question "What's it to you?" <br><br>

			This project is meant to encourage the viewer to think and to learn more about the world around us.<br><br>

			Encourage and love your neighbor, because you never know what that person is going through.</p>
