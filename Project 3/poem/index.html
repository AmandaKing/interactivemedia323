		<h3> Street Song</h3>

			<p>I am what I am.<br>
			I was made like this.<br>
			So I laugh too loud?<br>
			Just as loud as I wish.<br>

			I love who loves me<br>
			And I don't feel to blame, <br>
			If the man that I love<br>
			Isn't always the same.<br>

			I was made like this,<br>
			What I am, I must be.<br>
			If you're looking for more,<br>
			Why bother with me?<br>

			So I'm made to please<br>
			And my heels are too high,<br>
			And I shorten my skirts<br>
			And mascara my eyes?<br>

			So my shape's too much shape<br>
			And my breasts are too firm?<br>
			So God made my shape,<br>
			Why don't you ask him?<br>

			So what's it to you<br>
			If I am what I am<br>
			And please who I please<br>
			And please who I can?<br>

			Why must you know<br>
			How I got this way?<br>
			Of course, it was love.<br>
			Of course, he loved me.<br>

			Like children in love<br>
			We knew how to love,<br>
			To love and to loveâ€¦<br>
			What the hell's it to you?<br>

			I'm here to please you<br>
			Just as soon as you've paid.<br>
			What else can I do?<br>
			It's the way things were made<br><br>
